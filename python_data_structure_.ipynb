        "  * Use **lists** for dynamic data\n",
        "  * Use **tuples** for fixed or constant data\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        " - Dictionaries in Python store data as key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each key is unique and maps to a value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data is stored using a hash table, allowing fast lookups\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        " - You might use a set instead of a list when:\n",
        "\n",
        "You need unique items (sets automatically remove duplicates).\n",
        "\n",
        "You want faster membership checks (in is faster in sets).\n",

        "6. P What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        " - A string in Python is a sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes (\" \" or ' ').\n",

        "7.  How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        " - **Tuples** ensure data integrity by being **immutable**—once created, their contents **cannot be changed**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why it matters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Prevents accidental modifications\n",

        "Tuples protect data from changes, making them ideal for storing constant, reliable values.\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        " - A **hash table** is a data structure that stores data using **key-value pairs** and allows **fast access** using a **hash function**.\n",

        " - **Strings are immutable** in Python to ensure **efficiency and consistency**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory optimization:** Immutable strings can be shared between variables, reducing memory usage.\n",
        "- **Safety:** Ensures that string values cannot be accidentally modified, avoiding bugs.\n",

        " - Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster lookups: Accessing values by key is much faster (O(1) time complexity) compared to searching through a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key-value mapping: Ideal for tasks that require associating unique keys with values (e.g., user IDs to names).\n",
        "\n",
        "No duplicates: Keys are unique, ensuring no repeated entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        " - A tuple would be preferable over a list in scenarios where the data should remain **constant and unchangeable**. For example, storing **coordinates** of a location:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "coordinates = (40.7128, 74.0060)  # Latitude, Longitude\n",

        "Use tuples when you need **immutable** data, like fixed configuration settings or coordinates.\n",
        "13.  How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        " - **Sets** automatically **remove duplicate values**. When you try to add a duplicate, it is ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3}\n",
        "# Result: {1, 2, 3} (duplicate 3 is removed)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**In short:**\n",
        "Sets only keep **unique values** and discard duplicates.\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        " - The **`in`** keyword works differently for **lists** and **dictionaries**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Lists:** Checks if a value **exists** in the list.\n",
        "\n",

        "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "  2 in my_list  # Returns True\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Dictionaries:** Checks if a **key** exists in the dictionary.\n",

        "  my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n",
        "  \"a\" in my_dict  # Returns True\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "**In short:**\n",
        "For lists, `in` checks values; for dictionaries, `in` checks keys.\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        " - No, you **cannot modify** the elements of a tuple because **tuples are immutable** in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Once a tuple is created, its data **cannot be changed**, which ensures **data integrity**.\n",
        "* This immutability makes tuples more efficient in terms of memory and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In short:**\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be modified after creation.\n",
        "16.  What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        " - A **nested dictionary** is a dictionary where the value of a key is another dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Use Case:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Nested dictionaries are useful for representing hierarchical or structured data, such as storing information about multiple employees in a company.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "employees = {\n",
        "    \"John\": {\"age\": 30, \"role\": \"Engineer\"},\n",
        "    \"Alice\": {\"age\": 28, \"role\": \"Manager\"}\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**In short:**\n",
        "A nested dictionary allows you to store data in a **key-value** format where values can be other dictionaries, ideal for structured data.\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        " - The time complexity of accessing elements in a **dictionary** is **O(1)** on average.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is because dictionaries use a **hash table** to map keys to values, allowing direct access to values based on their keys, which is very fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In short:**\n",
        "Accessing elements in a dictionary is generally **constant time (O(1))**.\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        " - **Lists** are preferred over **dictionaries** in situations where:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Order matters**: Lists maintain the order of elements, while dictionaries do not guarantee order until Python 3.7+ (though not primarily designed for that).\n",
        "- **Index-based access**: If you need to access elements by position (index) rather than by a key.\n",
        "- **Simple collections**: When you just need a **sequence of items** (e.g., numbers, strings) without needing key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In short:**\n",
        "Use lists when you need **ordered, index-based** data without keys.\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        " - Dictionaries in Python are considered **unordered** because, prior to Python 3.7, they did not guarantee the order of the key-value pairs. Even in Python 3.7 and later, while the insertion order is preserved, dictionaries are still designed to be accessed by keys, not by a specific order.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Impact on Data Retrieval:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Access is by key**: You retrieve values using keys, not positions, so order doesn't affect how data is accessed.\n",
        "* **Faster lookups**: Since dictionaries are optimized for fast key-based lookups (O(1) on average), order doesn't matter for retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In short:**\n",
        "Dictionaries are unordered, but this doesn't affect how you retrieve data (via keys), and it enables fast access.\n",

        " - **Data Retrieval in Lists vs Dictionaries:**\n",
